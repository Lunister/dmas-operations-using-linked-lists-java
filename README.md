# DMAS-operations-using-linked-lists-java

In this repository I've created different classes and functions to perform DMAS operations on numbers with each digit stored in a different linked list.

The program is well commented for understanding.

It takes the input of two numbers from the user and then store each digit in a different node of a singly-linked list and then perform the selected operation on the two liked lists taken as input from the user.
